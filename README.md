# smash-and-dash

Indie project made in python using the library Pygame

NOTE: This project was made before vibe-coding was a thing B) 
(And on a serious note, over all, it was pretty much just an excuse to learn some python.)

Versions:
pygame 2.1.2 (SDL 2.0.18, Python 3.10.8)

To run this, all you need to do is to install the correct versions of Python and Pygame and run the main.py file unsing Python.

You can also download the mp4 file and check out a quick little video of what the game looks like.
